## Nice cool **gulp receipts** all together

Gulppage is a simple gulp receipts stack working all together to **let you focus 
on the cool stuff: the dev**.

It comes with **usefull common tasks** for dev such as _linters_, _livereload_,...

It brings you **other less known tools** such as easy fonticon integration, markdown
html integration on the fly, so you can dev faster.

And once your job is finished, you can directly **export your work**, already 
optimized, with assets/css/js optimization all in a clean tarball.
